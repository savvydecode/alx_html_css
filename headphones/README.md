0. read and be familiar with figma
Important notes with Figma:

if your computer doesn’t have the fonts used, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float - feel free to round them
For this task, please write an amazing README.md

Interactions note:

the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
links hover/active: #FF6565
button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page


1. HEADER
Building a web page the right way, is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:

reset CSS styling
use variables
simple (as generic as you can) CSS selectors
avoid (as much as you can) super specific CSS selector
simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece
