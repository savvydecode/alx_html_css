HEADPHONES
A project that comprises of all that aspect of html and css taught. This is the final project to climax html and css. 
The requirements for each task are below:

0. read and be familiar with figma
Important notes with Figma:

if your computer doesn’t have the fonts used, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float - feel free to round them
For this task, please write an amazing README.md

Interactions note:

the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
links hover/active: #FF6565
button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page


1. HEADER
Building a web page the right way, is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:

reset CSS styling
use variables
simple (as generic as you can) CSS selectors
avoid (as much as you can) super specific CSS selector
simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

2. WHAT WE DO.. SECTION
Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

7. LET'S ANIMATE ITEMS
From 4-index.html and 4-styles.css, add fun animations to “What we do…” and “Our results” sections items row. Either all the time, either when hover.

Scaling, opacity, rotation, bouncing… many options!

8. HUMBERGER MENU.
Copy files from the previous task.

In this task, you’ll enhance the responsiveness of your page by adding a hamburger menu using JavaScript so that it looks like the images we’ve shared in the previous tasks.

On screens 480px or less:
- Show a hamburger icon instead of the full navigation links
- When clicked, the icon should toggle the menu open and close
- Use JavaScript (no frameworks)

Keep your styles clean and animations smooth.
