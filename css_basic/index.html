                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a student web developer at ALX, passionate about
                    building innovative and user-friendly applications. With a
                    background in medicine as an intern physician assistant, I
                    bring a unique perspective to web development.
                </p>

                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <h3>From Medicine to Tech</h3>
                <p>
                    My journey into web development began with a curiosity about
                    technology and its potential to improve healthcare. As I
                    explored the intersection of medicine and tech, I discovered
                    a passion for coding and problem-solving.
                </p>

                <h3>Web Development Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    I've developed skills in front-end development, including
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm excited to continue learning
                    and growing as a web developer.
                </p>

                <h3>My Projects</h3>
